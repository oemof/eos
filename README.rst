This repository holds oemof applications to model local energy systems with special focus on storage capacity and system costs. 

This is the repository of the dissertation project which is described here in German: https://reiner-lemoine-institut.de/optimierung-von-speichergroessen-stromversorgungssystemen-beispiel-einer-energieregion-und-unter-beruecksichtigung-verschiedener-autarkiegrade/
and in English: https://reiner-lemoine-institut.de/en/storage-demand-and-system-costs-of-energy-supply-from-the-perspective-of-energy-regions-and-energetic-quarters/

You can find the latest code in the branch_publish. This branch has still some pending issues as for example the documentation of the code, but will be merged soon into the master branch.
